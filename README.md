This project can be used to code protect any electrical device (like an electronic door, lock or safe). The user must enter a correct password to gain access. The password is entered using the built in 4×4 keypad matrix. The main LCD Module is used to display messages to the user. As soon as correct password is entered the relay is activated. This is indicated by a LED which is placed near the relay. The relay remains on as long as the user wishes. You just need to press a key to deactivate the relay. After typing four digit password you must press the "OK" button (ON/C). At anytime you may press the "Cancel" key (=) to clear the input (e.g. when you enter any incorrect digit) The smart code lock has the feature to change the password too. For this enter a special password which is ‘0000’, as soon as the system receives this special password it switches to change password mode. Here you need to enter the old password to gain permission, then enter the new password.
